## Project Overview

This repository documents the development of a **microcontroller-based pulse oximeter** that leverages wireless data transmission via Wi-Fi for remote health monitoring. It was developed as part of a Bachelorâ€™s thesis in **Information and Communication Technology Engineering** at HTW Berlin.

The system measures **SpOâ‚‚ (blood oxygen saturation)** and **BPM (heart rate)** using optical sensors, processes the signals through analog conditioning and a **PIC16F1936 microcontroller**, displays them on an LCD, and sends the data to the **ThingSpeak IoT platform** using an ESP32-C6 module.

## System Description

The system is built to detect heart rate and SpOâ‚‚ levels using a **transmitter-receiver optical sensor arrangement**. The analog signal undergoes conditioning (filtering and amplification), is digitized using a PIC16F1937 microcontroller, and then transmitted via UART to an ESP32 module, which finally uploads the data to the **ThingSpeak IoT platform** over WiFi.

This implementation follows a modular approach separating:

- **Sensor input and analog conditioning**
- **Signal digitization and data processing**
- **Wireless transmission and data visualization**

---

## Architecture Overview

The complete system is split into three main modules:

1. **Analog Front-End (AFE)**:
   - Sensor: IR LED and BPW34 photodiode
   - Signal conditioning: low-pass & high-pass filters, current-to-voltage converter, non-inverting amplifier

2. **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)**:
   - PIC16F1937 with ADC to digitize signals
   - UART communication with ESP32

3. **Connectivity & Visualization**:
   - ESP32 C6 receives UART data
   - Sends it to ThingSpeak cloud server
   - Real-time data charts shown on the dashboard

Diagrams of this architecture can be found in the `images/` folder and on the web version.

## Hardware Design

Schematic design and PCB layouts were made using **EAGLE**. The hardware is modular and comprises:

- Pulse sensor circuits for both RED and IR light
- Custom-designed PCBs for:
  - Signal conditioning
  - Power regulation
  - Sensor connection
- 16x2 LCD display for real-time visualization

The `hardware/` folder contains:
- `.sch` and `.brd` files for Eagle
- PDF exports for quick access
- Rendered PCB previews (top, bottom, drill)

## Firmware and Software

### PIC16F1937 Firmware

- Written in C using MPLAB X IDE and MCC (Microchip Code Configurator)
- Core features:
  - ADC configuration for analog signals
  - UART communication setup
  - Data formatting and LCD update

See: `firmware/SpO2_Oximetro_Calculo/`

### ESP32 UART Receiver

- Programmed using Arduino Framework
- Parses UART data from PIC
- Establishes WiFi connection and sends data to ThingSpeak

See: `software/USART_Receptor_WIFI/USART_Receptor_WIFI.ino`

---

## Data Transmission and Visualization

- Platform: [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com)
- Two data fields:
  - SpOâ‚‚ (%)
  - Heart Rate (bpm)
- Real-time data graphs
- Dashboard view available for sharing and monitoring
